## For undergraduate students

The graduate students of the Math Department at the University of Rochester offer mentoring for undergraduate students:

- Suppose you want to discuss your <a href ="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/undergraduate/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REU project</a> with a graduate student, or
- you wish to attend graduate school in the future but have no idea what it looks like or how to apply.

For the Fall 2025 semester we are running a reading groups program, where you can learn about a topic by reading books or papers under the guidance of a graduate student. These reading group topics can possibly turn into an <a href ="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/undergraduate/honors-thesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honors thesis</a> by expanding upon the work done with a faculty advisor.
**Reading groups are open to all students and non-majors are encouraged to join.**

<!-- All other groups are now started for Spring 2024. If you would still like to try to join a reading group,
contact Donovan. -->

If you have any comments or questions, contact [Donovan Snyder](/PotfolioSite).
