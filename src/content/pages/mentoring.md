## For undergraduate students

The graduate students of the Math Department at the University of Rochester offer mentoring for undergraduate students:

- Suppose you want to discuss your <a href ="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/undergraduate/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REU project</a> with a graduate student, or
- you wish to attend graduate school in the future but have no idea what it looks like or how to apply.

For the Fall 2025 semester we are running a reading groups program, where you can learn about a topic by reading books or papers under the guidance of a graduate student. These reading group topics can possibly turn into an <a href ="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/undergraduate/honors-thesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honors thesis</a> by expanding upon the work done with a faculty advisor.
**Reading groups are open to all students and non-majors are encouraged to join.**

### Sign up for a reading group by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqE3bh3-KvN-MdAstsOZ0RBUyO6B_fW3DVswEVkgafLOo--A/viewform?usp=header). We will reach out to you by September 12!

<!-- All other groups are now started for Spring 2024. If you would still like to try to join a reading group,
contact Donovan. -->

If you have any comments or questions, contact [Donovan Snyder](/PortfolioSite).

### Topics in Category Theory

- _Grad student organizer_: Siddharth Gurumurthy
- _Description_: The preliminary plan is to talk about the basic concepts in category theory: categories, functors, the Yoneda lemma, (co)limits and adjunctions with a bunch of examples. The plan is subject to change and will depend on the available time and the interests of the participant(s).
- _Prerequisites_: Math 236 is required. Math 237 and 240 will help substantially.
- _Resources to be Used_: _Notes on Category Theory_ - Paolo Perrone, _Category Theory in Context_ - Emily Riehl, _Basic Category Theory_ - Tom Leinster.

### High-Dimensional Figures and Mapping Degree

- _Grad student organizer_: Lippus Liu
- _Description_: One might find it easy to think about figures in a 2-dimensional plane. Imagining figures in a 3-dimensional space might also be not that hard. But what if we move to 4-dimensional spaces, or 5, 6, or even higher? Imagination in these cases turns out to be not very helpful. To solve this problem, topologists developed so-called "topological invariants", which can normally be derived by just computations. In this reading group, we will learn about a particular example, that is the mapping degree, which can be used to distinguish mappings between high-dimensional figures.
- _Prerequisites_: Some basic multi-variable calculus (MATH 164/174) and point-set topology (MATH 240) is required. Some knowledge to manifolds will be helpful.
- _Resources to be Used_: _Topology from the differentiable viewpoint_ - John Milnor

### Algebraic Methods to solve Probabilistic Models

- _Grad student organizer_: Donovan Snyder
- _Description_: The area of "integrable probability" is the study of systems that can be studied and analyzed using algebra: sometimes complicated group and Lie theory, but often times more simple procedures. We'll deal with those more simple procedures to look at examples such as ASEP, the Polymer, and Six-Vertex models and answer basic questions.
- _Prerequisites_: We will need to know the ideas of probability (MATH 201) and will freely use multi-variable calculus and linear algebra (MATH 164,165,235). The ideas of algebra (MATH 236) will be very helpful.
- _Resources to be Used_: Depends on the interest of the student, but likely _Lectures on integrable probability_ - Borodin and Gorin, _Random polymers via orthogonal Whittaker and symplectic Schur functions_ - Bisi, _Stochastic six-vertex model_ - Borodin, Corwin, and Gorin
