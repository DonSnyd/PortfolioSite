## Research

Broadly, my work involves analyzing probabilistic models using algebraic tools. I work with my advisors Arjun Krishnan and Jon Pakianathan. More specifically, I’ve studied

- The log-gamma Polymer Model under the force of an external field
- Applications of algebraic structures to settings like the Ising Model, the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process, and the Stochastic Six-Vertex Model
- The use of Hopf algebras in statistical mechanics, including extracting a Markov Chain with a phase transition.

Previously, I’ve studied a variety of things:

- Using VC-dimension to construct witness sets in fractal settings

  Work with Alex Iosevich and Emmett Wyman

- A “quantum probability” and an example of a two state random walk

  My undergraduate Math and Physics Thesis, work with Sarada Rajeev

- Creating a theory of data movement distance to measure algorithmic complexity.

  Work with Chen Ding in the Systems Group of the Computer Science Department
