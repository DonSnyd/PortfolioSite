## Research

My work involves analyzing probabilistic models using algebraic tools. Most recently, that involves Polymer and Six-Vertex models using techniques like geometric RSK and the Yang-Baxter equation. If you're interested or want to talk, reach out! I go more in depth on the [research page](/PortfolioSite/research)

## Teaching

I have a passion for teaching, whether it be upper-level courses for math majors, introductory courses for non-majors, or tutoring. See more about my philosophy and experience on the [teaching page](/PortfolioSite/teaching)

## Mentoring

I am currently directing our graduate student’s reading program for undergraduates. I run my own reading group, often based on my research. [Look here](/PortfolioSite/mentoring) if you are interested in participating.

### Education

As an undergraduate, I got an Honors B.S. in Math and a B.S. Physics at the University of Rochester, while also minoring in Music.
I’ve received my Master of Arts in Mathematics, also from the University of Rochester.

## Music

I've played the viola since I was young, and continue playing in orchestras around Rochester. In my time at U of R, I've been an active member of the Music Department on the River Campus and participated in opportunities at Eastman.

I was fortunate enough to also be given the chance to be an Assistant Conductor for the University of Rochester Orchestras, conducting multiple times in concerts and rehearsals.

For many years, I was also the Head librarian and took care of many related administrative duties.

I am relatively new to the conducting end of things, but if you are curious in what I've done, feel free to reach out!

## Athletics

I've worked on the game operations staff in the Athletic Department at U of R since my first year. We track and collect live play-by-play statistics, run the scoreboard and clocks, and complete other administrative duties during the matches/games of the varsity athletic teams.
