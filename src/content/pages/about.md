## Research

Broadly, my work involves analyzing probabilistic models using algebraic tools. I work with my advisors Arjun Krishnan and Jon Pakianathan. More specifically, I’ve studied

- The log-gamma Polymer Model under the force of an external field
- Applications of algebraic structures to settings like the Ising Model, the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process, and the Stochastic Six-Vertex Model
- The use of Hopf algebras in statistical mechanics, including extracting a Markov Chain with a phase transition.

Previously, I’ve studied a variety of things:

- Using VC-dimension to construct witness sets in fractal settings

  Work with Alex Iosevich and Emmett Wyman

- A “quantum probability” and an example of a two state random walk

  My undergraduate Math and Physics Thesis, work with Sarada Rajeev

- Creating a theory of data movement distance to measure algorithmic complexity.

  Work with Chen Ding in the Systems Group of the Computer Science Department

## Previous Teaching

#### As an Instructor at the University of Rochester

- MATH 140, _Foundations of Calculus_
  - Fall 2024, Course coordinator and instructor
  - College Algebra and Trigonometry in preparation for Calculus
  - Adapt syllabus, lead class, coordinate TAs, manage WeBWorK assignments, create and grade exams
- Math 143, _Calculus III_
  - Summers 2022-2024, Springs 2024-2025 as instructor
  - Summer 2025 as course coordinator and instructor
  - Part of Calculus 2, including sequences, series, parametric equations, and polar coordinates
- MATH 120 _Precalculus Module_
  - Summers 2021-2025 as instructor, course designer, and head math instructor
  - College Algebra and Trigonometry for incoming first year students in the Early Connections Opportunity program
  - Design course curriculum and syllabus, manage other instructors, mentor students, collaborate with other faculty and staff to prepare scholars

#### As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Rochester

- MATH 140, _Foundations of Calculus_, recitation leader
- MATH 218, _Math Modeling of the Life Sciences_, grading, substitute lectures
- MATH 263, _Qualitivate Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations_, grading
- MATH 436, _Graduate Algebra I_, grading
- MATH 173, _Honors Linear Algebra_, recitation leader, substitute lectures
- MATH 143, _Calculus III_, recitation leader
- MATH 141, _Calculus I_, recitation leader
  Generally, recitation leaders lead 3 small student, active learning workshops each week, grade exams, and help as substitutes for some lectures. Graders grade weekly homework assignments, exams, and provide assistance with course management.

## Mentoring

I am currently directing our graduate student’s reading program for undergraduates. I run my own reading group, often based on my research. Reach out to me if you are interested in participating.

### Education

As an undergraduate, I got an Honors B.S. in Math and a B.S. Physics at the University of Rochester, while also minoring in Music.
I’ve received my Master of Arts in Mathematics, also from the University of Rochester.
